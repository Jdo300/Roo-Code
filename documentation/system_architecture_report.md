Okay, Jason, I have reviewed the relevant documentation files (`roocode-api.md`, `rpc_client_library_plan.md`, `websocket_api_schema.md`, `websocket_server_settings_implementation.md`, `websocket_server_specs.md`) and the associated code files (`test-node-client.js`, `test-start-task.js`, `src/exports/api.ts`, `src/exports/ipc.ts`, `src/schemas/ipc.ts`, `src/schemas/index.ts`).

Here is an explanation of the IPC server/client architecture, how the components relate, and the flow of commands and events:

**1. Overall Architecture**

The system is designed with a clear separation of concerns:

- **External Client (e.g., `test-node-client.js`):** An external application that wants to interact with the Roo Code extension.
- **Client Library (`RooCodeClient`):** A Node.js library used by the external client to handle the low-level IPC communication details (connection, message framing, serialization, request/response matching).
- **IPC Server (`IpcServer`):** Runs within the Roo Code VS Code extension. It manages the TCP (or Unix socket) connection, receives raw messages from clients, and emits structured events internally.
- **API (`API` class):** Also runs within the Roo Code extension. It acts as the public interface for external clients. It listens for events from the `IpcServer`, translates incoming commands into calls to core Roo Code functionality (often via `ClineProvider` and `Cline`), and formats responses/events to be sent back via the `IpcServer`.
- **ClineProvider:** Manages the overall state of the Roo Code extension, including configuration, task history, and the stack of active `Cline` instances. The `API` class interacts with the `ClineProvider` to access and modify this state and to initiate new tasks.
- **Cline:** Represents a single task or conversation with the language model. It handles the core logic of processing user input, executing tools, and generating responses. The `ClineProvider` manages `Cline` instances, and the `API` interacts with the _current_ `Cline` instance for actions like sending messages or pressing buttons.

**2. Communication Flow**

The communication follows a request-response and event-driven pattern over a TCP (or Unix socket) connection managed by `node-ipc`:

- **Connection Handshake:**

    1. The Client Library (`RooCodeClient`) initiates a TCP connection to the address the `IpcServer` is listening on (default `localhost:7800`).
    2. The `IpcServer` accepts the connection.
    3. The `IpcServer` generates a unique `clientId` for the new connection.
    4. The `IpcServer` sends an `Ack` message back to the client containing the assigned `clientId`, `pid`, and `ppid`.
    5. The Client Library receives the `Ack` message, stores the `clientId`, and emits a "connect" event.

- **Command Flow (Client Request -> Server Response):**

    1. The Client Library calls an API method (e.g., `client.getProfiles()`).
    2. The Client Library constructs a `TaskCommand` message with the appropriate `commandName` and `data`, including its stored `clientId`.
    3. The Client Library sends the `TaskCommand` message over the TCP socket.
    4. The `IpcServer` receives the message, validates its format using `ipcMessageSchema`, and emits a `TaskCommand` event internally, including the `clientId` and the command data.
    5. The `API` class, which listens for `IpcMessageType.TaskCommand` events from the `IpcServer`, receives the event.
    6. The `API`'s listener uses a `switch` statement based on `command.commandName` to call the corresponding method on the `API` instance (e.g., `this.getProfiles()`).
    7. The `API` method performs the requested action (e.g., retrieves profiles from `ClineProvider`).
    8. The `API` method calls `this.sendResponse(clientId, commandName, resultData)` to format the result into a `TaskEvent` message with `eventName: RooCodeEventName.Message` and the result data in the payload.
    9. The `API` uses `this.ipc.send()` to send this `TaskEvent` back to the specific client identified by `clientId`.
    10. The Client Library receives the `TaskEvent`, matches it to the original request using the `clientId` (and potentially other correlation IDs, though not explicitly detailed in the schema for responses), and resolves the Promise returned by the initial API method call with the response data.

- **Event Flow (Server Event -> Client Notification):**
    1. Core Roo Code functionality (e.g., a `Cline` instance) emits an event (e.g., "message", "taskCompleted").
    2. The `ClineProvider`, which listens to `Cline` events, receives the event.
    3. The `ClineProvider` (or potentially the `API` listening to `ClineProvider` events) emits a corresponding `RooCodeEventName` event.
    4. The `API` class, which listens for these `RooCodeEventName` events, receives the event.
    5. The `API` constructs a `TaskEvent` message with the appropriate `eventName` and `payload`.
    6. The `API` uses `this.ipc.broadcast()` or `this.ipc.send()` (if the event is client-specific, using `relayClientId`) to send the `TaskEvent` to connected clients.
    7. The Client Library receives the `TaskEvent`, parses its `eventName` and `payload`, and emits a corresponding event from the `RooCodeClient` instance.
    8. The external client application, which has subscribed to these events, receives the notification.

**3. Message Structure and Validation**

- All messages adhere to the `ipcMessageSchema` (defined in `src/schemas/ipc.ts`), which is a discriminated union based on the `type` field (`TaskCommand`, `TaskEvent`, `Ack`).
- **`TaskCommand`:** Used for client-to-server requests. Contains `type: "TaskCommand"`, `origin: "client"`, `clientId`, and `data: { commandName, data }`.
- **`TaskEvent`:** Used for server-to-client notifications and responses. Contains `type: "TaskEvent"`, `origin: "server"`, optional `relayClientId`, and `data: { eventName, payload }`. The `eventName` corresponds to `RooCodeEventName` values, and the `payload` structure varies depending on the event.
- **`Ack`:** Used for the initial server acknowledgment. Contains `type: "Ack"`, `origin: "server"`, and `data: { clientId, pid, ppid }`.
- **Validation:** Zod schemas (`ipcMessageSchema`, `taskCommandSchema`, `taskEventSchema`, etc.) are used to validate incoming messages on the server side (`IpcServer.onMessage`) to ensure they conform to the expected structure and types.

**4. Component Responsibilities (Detailed)**

- **`RooCodeClient`:**

    - Manages the TCP connection state and reconnection logic.
    - Handles message framing (based on `node-ipc`'s protocol).
    - Serializes outgoing JavaScript objects to JSON and deserializes incoming JSON to JavaScript objects.
    - Maintains a map of pending requests to match incoming responses (`TaskEvent`s with response payloads) to the original `TaskCommand`s.
    - Provides an EventEmitter interface for subscribing to server-sent events (`TaskEvent`s).
    - Exposes methods that mirror the `RooCodeAPI` interface, translating calls into `TaskCommand` messages.

- **`IpcServer`:**

    - Uses `node-ipc` to listen for and manage TCP connections.
    - Assigns unique `clientId`s to connected clients.
    - Emits internal events (`IpcMessageType.Connect`, `IpcMessageType.Disconnect`, `IpcMessageType.TaskCommand`, `IpcMessageType.TaskEvent`) when messages are received or connection state changes.
    - Provides `send()` and `broadcast()` methods to send messages to specific clients or all clients.

- **`API` class:**

    - Instantiated by the main extension code, receiving the `ClineProvider` instance.
    - Initializes and holds a reference to the `IpcServer`.
    - Listens for `IpcMessageType.TaskCommand` events from the `IpcServer`.
    - Routes incoming commands to the appropriate `API` method (`startNewTask`, `getProfiles`, etc.).
    - Interacts with the `ClineProvider` to perform the requested actions (e.g., `sidebarProvider.initClineWithTask`, `sidebarProvider.getConfiguration`).
    - Uses `this.sendResponse()` to format data into `TaskEvent` messages and send them back via `this.ipc.send()`.
    - Listens for core Roo Code events (e.g., from `ClineProvider` or `Cline` instances) and emits corresponding `RooCodeEventName` events via `this.emit()` for external clients to subscribe to.

- **`ClineProvider`:**

    - Manages the lifecycle of `Cline` instances (task stack).
    - Provides methods for initiating new tasks (`initClineWithTask`, `initClineWithHistoryItem`), managing the task stack (`addClineToStack`, `removeClineFromStack`, `getCurrentTaskStack`), and cancelling tasks (`cancelTask`).
    - Handles persistence of task history and configuration.
    - Provides access to the current configuration and state (`getState`, `getConfiguration`, `updateApiConfiguration`).
    - Listens to events from `Cline` instances and re-emits them as `RooCodeEventName` events.

- **`Cline`:**
    - Represents a single task execution.
    - Manages the conversation history (`apiConversationHistory`, `clineMessages`).
    - Handles tool execution and interaction with the language model.
    - Emits task-specific events (e.g., "message", "taskCompleted", "taskAborted").
    - Includes methods like `handleWebviewAskResponse` which are used by the `API` to simulate user interaction (sending messages, pressing buttons).

**5. Settings and Configuration**

- IPC server settings (mode, host, port, socket path) are part of the extension's global state, managed by `ContextProxy` and `ProviderSettingsManager`.
- These settings are exposed in the VS Code settings UI (`SettingsView.tsx`).
- Changes to these settings in the UI trigger messages to the extension, which update the global state and can cause the IPC server to restart with the new configuration (`websocket_server_settings_implementation.md`).

**6. Error Handling**

- Errors can occur at multiple layers: network connection issues, invalid message formats, errors during command processing on the server, or errors within core Roo Code functionality.
- The Client Library is responsible for handling network errors (`ECONNREFUSED`, timeouts) and RPC errors returned by the server.
- The `IpcServer` validates incoming messages and logs invalid payloads.
- The `API`'s `TaskCommand` listener includes a `try...catch` block to handle errors during the execution of API methods and sends an error response back to the client using `sendResponse`.
- Core Roo Code functionality (within `Cline` or `ClineProvider`) should log errors and potentially emit `TaskToolFailed` or other relevant events.

**7. Identified Issues/Improvements**

Based on the review, here are some points:

- **Client ID Handling in API:** The `API`'s `TaskCommand` listener receives the `clientId`, but some methods that send responses (`isTaskInHistory`, `getCurrentTaskStack`, `getConfiguration`, `getProfiles`, `getActiveProfile`, `SetConfiguration`, `CreateProfile`, `SetActiveProfile`, `DeleteProfile`, `isReady`) were using `this.ipc?.getFirstClientId() || "..."` as the `requestingClientId`. While `getFirstClientId` was added to `IpcServer`, it's more robust to use the `clientId` received directly in the `TaskCommand` event for sending responses specific to that client. This needs refinement in the `API`'s command handling logic.
- **`cancelTask` Implementation:** The current `cancelTask` implementation in `API` only supports cancelling the _current_ task. If the `taskMap` is intended to track active `ClineProvider` instances by task ID, the `cancelTask` method should use this map to find the correct provider and call `provider.cancelTask()` on it for non-current tasks.
- **`GetMessages` and `GetTokenUsage`:** These commands are mentioned in the schema and handled in the `API`'s switch statement but are currently just logged as "Method not implemented." These need to be fully implemented, likely by retrieving data from the relevant `Cline` instance (if active) or task history.
- **`CloseTask`:** The implementation in the `API`'s switch statement only handles closing the _current_ task if its ID matches. Its behavior for non-current tasks needs clarification and implementation if necessary.
- **`resumeTask`:** As noted in the code, the exact behavior and interaction with `sendMessage` for resuming a task paused for input might need further clarification or implementation details in `Cline`.
- **Error Response Consistency:** Ensure error responses sent via `sendResponse` consistently follow a defined structure (e.g., an object with an `error` field).
- **Task Map Usage:** Clarify the intended purpose and usage of the `taskMap` in the `API` class. If it's meant to track active `ClineProvider` instances by task ID, ensure it's populated correctly when tasks are created/started and used consistently (e.g., in `cancelTask`).

This review provides a comprehensive overview of the architecture and highlights areas that need attention to ensure the IPC API is fully functional and robust.

Now, please rebuild and restart the Roo Code plugin. Once it's ready and the server is listening on port 7800, we can proceed with testing the client again, keeping these architectural points in mind.
