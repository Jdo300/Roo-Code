# Active Context

## Current Task

Implementing and testing RPC server functionality for Roo Code extension, specifically focusing on message streaming behavior over IPC.

## Recent Changes

1. Added comprehensive logging to RPC server.
2. **Implemented a new IPC testing framework:**
    - Created a reusable client library: [`rpc-tcp-test/ipc-client.mjs`](rpc-tcp-test/ipc-client.mjs).
    - Developed individual test scripts for each IPC command in [`rpc-tcp-test/commands/`](rpc-tcp-test/commands/).
    - Created an event monitoring script: [`rpc-tcp-test/commands/monitorTaskEvents.mjs`](rpc-tcp-test/commands/monitorTaskEvents.mjs).
    - Documented the new framework in [`rpc-tcp-test/commands/README.md`](rpc-tcp-test/commands/README.md).
3. Attempted to implement delta streaming for partial `completion_result` messages sent over IPC in `src/exports/api.ts`.
4. Addressed `requestId` handling in server schemas ([`src/schemas/ipc.ts`](src/schemas/ipc.ts)) and client-side timeout logic in the (now superseded) [`rpc-tcp-test/test-ipc-handler.mjs`](rpc-tcp-test/test-ipc-handler.mjs).
5. Recompiled the extension (`pnpm run compile`).

## Next Steps

1.  **Systematic IPC Command Testing:** Utilize the new individual command scripts in [`rpc-tcp-test/commands/`](rpc-tcp-test/commands/) and the suggested test scenario in their `README.md` to verify the functionality of each IPC command. Log results and identify any failing commands.
2.  **Debug Failing Commands:** For any commands that fail, investigate the interaction between the client ([`rpc-tcp-test/ipc-client.mjs`](rpc-tcp-test/ipc-client.mjs) and the specific command script) and the server ([`src/exports/api.ts`](src/exports/api.ts) and [`src/exports/ipc.ts`](src/exports/ipc.ts)).
3.  **Verify Delta Streaming:** Once basic command functionality is confirmed across all commands, proceed to verify the delta streaming logic for `completion_result` messages using the new test framework.
4.  Test error handling and edge cases for streaming.

## Current Status

- A new, more robust IPC testing framework has been implemented in `rpc-tcp-test/`.
- The old `test-ipc-handler.mjs` is superseded by this new framework.
- RPC server logic (within the extension, specifically `src/exports/api.ts`) has been modified to _attempt_ sending text deltas over IPC.
- The extension has been recompiled.
- **Primary Focus:** Systematically test all IPC commands using the new framework to establish a baseline of working functionality before focusing on delta streaming.
- The delta streaming logic verification is paused until basic command integrity is confirmed.
