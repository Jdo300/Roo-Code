# Active Context

## Current Task

Implementing and testing RPC server functionality for Roo Code extension, specifically focusing on message streaming behavior over IPC.

## Recent Changes

1. **New IPC Testing Framework Implemented:**
    - Reusable client library: [`rpc-tcp-test/ipc-client.mjs`](rpc-tcp-test/ipc-client.mjs).
    - Individual command scripts: [`rpc-tcp-test/commands/`](rpc-tcp-test/commands/).
    - Event monitor: [`rpc-tcp-test/commands/monitorTaskEvents.mjs`](rpc-tcp-test/commands/monitorTaskEvents.mjs).
    - Documentation: [`rpc-tcp-test/commands/README.md`](rpc-tcp-test/commands/README.md).
2. **Attempted Test Suite Execution & Reversion:** Encountered significant TypeScript compatibility issues when trying to run the new `.mjs` test suite. Changes made to address these were reverted to maintain plugin stability. The test suite files remain, but are currently unusable due to these TS issues.
3. Previous work on delta streaming (`src/exports/api.ts`) and `requestId` handling remains.
4. Extension has been recompiled multiple times during previous debugging efforts.

## Next Steps

1. **Research Alternative Test Suite Approaches:**
    - Investigate using CommonJS (`.cjs`) for the Node.js test scripts in [`rpc-tcp-test/`](rpc-tcp-test/) to potentially avoid TypeScript compilation conflicts with the main plugin.
    - Explore the feasibility of a Python-based IPC client and test scripts, including how to ensure compatibility with the `node-ipc` message framing over TCP.
    - The goal is to find a solution with minimal impact on the existing plugin's TypeScript build system.
2. **Implement Recommended Test Suite Solution:** Based on research findings, implement the chosen approach for the test suite.
3. **Systematic IPC Command Testing:** Once a stable test suite is in place, systematically test all IPC commands.
4. **Debug Failing Commands:** Address any issues found during testing.
5. **Verify Delta Streaming:** After basic commands are stable, verify delta streaming.

## Current Status

- The new IPC testing framework structure ([`rpc-tcp-test/ipc-client.mjs`](rpc-tcp-test/ipc-client.mjs), [`rpc-tcp-test/commands/`](rpc-tcp-test/commands/)) is in place but unusable in its current `.mjs` form due to TypeScript conflicts.
- The old `test-ipc-handler.mjs` is superseded.
- RPC server logic for delta streaming in `src/exports/api.ts` is present but unverified.
- **Primary Focus:** Researching and deciding on a less disruptive approach for the IPC test suite (e.g., `.cjs` or Python) to enable reliable testing.
- Systematic testing and delta streaming verification are blocked until a stable and usable test suite solution is implemented.
